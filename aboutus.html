          <h1>Who We Are</h1>
          <p>We are so much more than a cafe…</p>

          <p>Since 1984, Cafe Latte has been serving up the freshest baked goods & modern comfort food in a cafeteria setting.  Our menu is prepared simply with the best ingredients available.  While many know us for our award winning desserts, customers love us for our signature lattes featuring Morningstar Coffee, ever changing selection of soups & salads, customizable sandwiches, spread sampler & our made to order pizzas.  Cafe Latte is a leader in sustainable dining, composting our food & paper waste along with recycling everything we can.</p>
          
          <p>“The Line” - Grab a tray & select from 7 soups, 5 prepared salads & 12 sandwiches options, along with custom sandwiches every day.</p> 
          
         <p>The Bakery offers fresh baked bread daily, along with cakes, tortes, tarts, cupcakes, scones & truffles.</p>
          
          <p>The Pizza & Wine Bar is the ideal place to meet friends or unwind at the end of the day, offering gourmet pizzas that pair perfectly with our 30+ wines by the glass.</p> 
          
          <p>Cafe Latte is owned by the Quinn family</p>
